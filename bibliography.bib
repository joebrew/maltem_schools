              continuing direct effect of prenatal and childhood health in

              intergenerational transmission of economic status takes place:
              cohort members born into poorer families experienced poorer

              mosquitoes. Our understanding of the malaria parasites begins in
              1880 with the discovery of the parasites in the blood of malaria
              patients by Alphonse Laveran. The sexual stages in the blood were
              discovered by William MacCallum in birds infected with a related
              haematozoan, Haemoproteus columbae, in 1897 and the whole of the
              transmission cycle in culicine mosquitoes and birds infected with
              Plasmodium relictum was elucidated by Ronald Ross in 1897. In
              1898 the Italian malariologists, Giovanni Battista Grassi, Amico
              Bignami, Giuseppe Bastianelli, Angelo Celli, Camillo Golgi and
              Ettore Marchiafava demonstrated conclusively that human malaria
              was also transmitted by mosquitoes, in this case anophelines. The
              discovery that malaria parasites developed in the liver before
              entering the blood stream was made by Henry Shortt and Cyril
              Garnham in 1948 and the final stage in the life cycle, the
              presence of dormant stages in the liver, was conclusively
              demonstrated in 1982 by Wojciech Krotoski. This article traces
              the main events and stresses the importance of comparative
              studies in that, apart from the initial discovery of parasites in
              the blood, every subsequent discovery has been based on studies
              on non-human malaria parasites and related organisms.",
